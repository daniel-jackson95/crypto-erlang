I assumed that E would be in
the top 3 letters for each 
column but I was wrong, so I
also included T as the top 
letter. This made a
permutation of 4^6 potential
keys, 4096 keys.
I then get the plaintext and
calculate the amount of words
that appear in tess27 and
assume that the most words 
that appear will be the 
correct plaintext.
I wrote a program to solve
this:
/src/exercise3.rb
Also uses:
/tools/tess.rb
/tools/utitlity.rb
/ciphers/vigenere.rb
