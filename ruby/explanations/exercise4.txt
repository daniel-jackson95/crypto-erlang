I found the key length of 8 by
analysing pairs of words [THE]
was repeated at X and Y and the difference was a multiple of 8 
which means that the key length is 8
I then assumed that E would be in the top 3 characters
this means that there are 3^8 keys to try 
I then found the plaintext which had the most words that are in tess27
