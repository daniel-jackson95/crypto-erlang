I found the key length of 8 by
analysing the text and finding
that ‘PROT’ appears 3 times
and that there is a spacing of
multiples of 8, so I assumed
that it was the key length.
I then assumed that E would be
 in the top 3 characters
this means that there are 3^8
 keys to try 
I then found the plaintext
which had the most words 
that are in tess27 and 
assumed that was the correct
plaintext

I wrote a program to solve
this:
/src/exercise4.rb
Also uses:
/tools/tess.rb
/tools/utility.rb
/ciphers/vigenere.rb
