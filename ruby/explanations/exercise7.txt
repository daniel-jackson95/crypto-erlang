HERSELF|HAD|FELT|TWO|OR|THREE|

First I do a letter frequency
analysis on the ciphertext in
which I make an assumption 
that the first common letter
is a space and that the 
second common letter is an E.
I then split the tess27 
text into words by splitting
with the assumed space
letter.
I then try to find words
which match a regex of the
assumed E character.
I then try all the
combinations of words which
can match the regex.
If a word fits, I add the
matching substitution
alphabet to the alphabet of
the function that called it
before. This may seem
confusing but at any time
there may be lots of
substitution alphabets in
the program which be branched
off of using different words
at different places.
I have some checks that say
if there is a complete 
substitution alphabet of 
length X and all the words
in the corresponding 
plaintext are words from
the tess27 split than it
should be the right 
plaintext.

I wrote a program to solve
this:
/src/exercise7.rb
Also uses:
/tools/tess.rb
/tools/utility.rb
/ciphers/substitution.rb
