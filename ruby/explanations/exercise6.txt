My solution finds all 
permutations of the column
ordering, so I end up with
6! keys = 720.
I then decrypt the ciphertext
with each key and calculate
the word frequency score.
At the end I pick the key
which produces the highest
word frequency score

I wrote a program to solve
this:
/src/exercise6.rb
Also uses:
/tools/tess.rb
/tools/utility.rb
/ciphers/transposition.rb
