I tried all the key lengths 
starting from 4 up to 8.
I split the ciphertext into 
equals columns as there are
keys, so 4 columns of 210
letters for a key of 4. I
then take the first letter 
of each successive column 
and add to a ‘plaintext’ 
variable. After the plaintext
is built I count the word
frequency length and repeat 
for all other key lengths.
At the end I pick the key 
which has the most frequent
words in it as my plaintext
I wrote a program to solve
this:
/src/exercise5.rb
Also uses:
/tools/tess.rb
/tools/utility.rb
/ciphers/transposition.rb
